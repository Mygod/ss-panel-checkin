  # Descriptions for some of the attributes
    Root:
      The root of the ss-panel site. You should not include strings like `user/index.php`, keep everything before that
      instead.
    UID, UserEmail, UserName, UserPwd:
      You can find the correct values for these fields in the cookies. You should leave email or user name blank if the
      cookie doesn't provide the information to make the program work properly.
    Proxy:
      You can specify the id of which proxy to use. If the specified id was not found, system proxy will be used. If the
      specified proxy doesn't have an address, direct connection will be used.
    Disabled:
      You can fill in `true` to make ss-panel-checkin ignore some of the sites while keep them in the XML. Useful for
      sites that are temporary down.
