# ss-panel-checkin
As we all know, the checkin feature in ss-panels is just a royal pain in the ass. This program is designed to help out those lazy ass people including me.

To use this program, create a file named config.csv under the same directory as the executive, and then add lines following the syntax:

	Site name,http://example.com,1,b598e776@opayq.com,,my_lame_encrypted_password

You can view your uid, email, user name and encrypted password in the cookies. You should leave email or user name blank if the cookie doesn't provide the information to make the program work properly.

After that, just double click on `ss-panel-checkin.exe` and everything will just work fine. If not, please check the log and try to resolve the problem. If you found any bugs/improvements, please open an issue or even better, submit a PR. :-D
